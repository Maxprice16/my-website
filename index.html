		<p>Welcome to the homepage for my new website! I am still playing with the site and constantly changing things. Most content currently on the site are little practice exercises for me. For example, on this page you will see links to other pages on my site, some styling, some images, captions, and a real time graph that I've embedded into the site's code. Getting these things onto the site were all ways for me to practice different skills needed to build an interesting, functional website. Please enjoy the site, it is a learning project in process!</p>
