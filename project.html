		<p>	My name is Max and this is my first attempt at making a website. I've had the idea to create my own webpage for years and now I'm finally diving into the project. I've wanted a place where I can post  camping trip reports, work stories, my resume, my workouts, and details about the so many other things that I have going on in my life. I am also envisioning a personal jumping-off site where I can go to read cool articles or relevant news stories that I have populating my site. I want it to be a place for myself, but also for others to get a glimpse of my life and what I find interesting. </p>

		<p>	I wanted to make this website from scratch by myself as a way to further engage with the project. I am learning html, css, and eventually other languages to help make this project come to life in the way that I want it to. I am writing these words from a text editor on my computer rather than using a canned website builder. While this is not the easiest way to go about creating a personal blog, it's a method that allows me to be more contientous of what I create, and learn something along the way. I also want ownership over my site and I want to be able to take pride in the final product. I imagine it will take quite awhile to create the content and style that I envision, but its been a rewarding process so far and I look forward to what it will become. </p>

		<p> Until I can get this page fully up-and-running, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010673854840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> you can find me on Facebook!</a></p>
